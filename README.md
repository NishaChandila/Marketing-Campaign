## 2. Python in Marketing Campaign Analysis  
Python plays a vital role in analyzing marketing campaign data. With its powerful libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, it enables efficient data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. Python's flexibility allows us to uncover patterns, perform predictive analysis, and automate reporting processes to streamline campaign evaluations.

## 3. Power BI Report  
To further enhance our analysis, I developed a Power BI report that provides an interactive view of our marketing performance. The report showcases key metrics such as reach, engagement rates, conversions, and ROI through dynamic dashboards. Power BIâ€™s visualizations make it easy to identify trends, monitor performance, and support data-driven decision-making.
